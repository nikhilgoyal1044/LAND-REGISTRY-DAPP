# 🏡 Land Registry using Blockchain  

## 📌 Introduction  
Traditional land ownership records are prone to fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies due to manual or centralized storage. This project introduces a **Blockchain-powered Land Registry System** that ensures **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof** land registration and ownership transfers.  

## 🎯 Project Objective  
- **Prevent fraud** by ensuring only verified owners can transfer land.  
- **Enhance transparency** with publicly verifiable ownership records.  
- **Eliminate intermediaries** by automating verification using smart contracts.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Blockchain (Ethereum, Solidity)** – Smart contract development  
- **Remix IDE** – Writing and deploying smart contracts  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend for interacting with the contract  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Land Registration:**  
   - Each land parcel is registered with a **unique ID**, location, and owner details.  
   - Only **unregistered land** can be added.  

2. **Ownership Verification:**  
   - Users can verify land ownership details on the blockchain.  

3. **Secure Transfers:**  
   - Only the **current owner** can sell or transfer land to another user.  
   - Transactions are **permanently recorded** on the blockchain.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  
- Implement **multi-signature approval** for land transfers.  
- Integrate **GPS-based verification** for accurate land mapping.  
- Deploy on **Layer-2 solutions** for reduced gas fees.
